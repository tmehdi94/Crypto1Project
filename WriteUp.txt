"TEAM NAME" Protocol:
    Backup Protection:
        All accounts are backed up for protection against power outage attacks.  The protocol backs up all accounts within a 5 second window to an encrypted AES file on the bank.
        The account_data.data file is checked upon the bank starting.  If the file exists it will read the accounts from that file, otherwise the default accounts are initialized.
        If time permitted this would have been better suited as a SQL database but due to resource limitations we took the file backup approach.
    
    Packet Padding:

    Packet Encryption:

    Key Exchange:

    Synchronization Protection:
        Locks exist for each account to prevent synchronization errors.

    Banking Error Protection:
        Integer datatype is used to hold balances.  We protect against overflows by installing a bank limit for the amount of money that can exist per account.
        Negative transfer/deposit commands are not allowed.

    ATM Login Protection:
	On account creation a card is generated for the particular account; this involves creation of a card hash. The card hash, the pin, and the appwide salt is used to generate an overall account hash for the account which is used to check for authentication. Accounts are allowed 3 login attempts before getting locked out.
