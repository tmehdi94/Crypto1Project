    Backup Protection:
        All accounts are backed up for protection against power outage attacks.  The protocol backs up all accounts within a 5 second window to an encrypted AES file on the bank.
        The account_data.data file is checked upon the bank starting.  If the file exists it will read the accounts from that file, otherwise the default accounts are initialized.
        If time permitted this would have been better suited as a SQL database but due to resource limitations we took the file backup approach.
